## Hi there üëã

Working at [MeaningfulData](https://www.meaningfuldata.eu/) developing solutions for the statistical and regulatory worlds. I am a Lead Software Engineer and Project Manager for the Open Source initiatives of my company, plus some other boutique/private projects for our clients.

We provide *CORRECT* software, well-tested, production-ready and standards-compliant.

In my pinned repositories you will find projects related to the SDMX, VTL and DPM standards:

### SDNX
- [pysdmx](https://github.com/bis-med-it/pysdmx) is an opinionated SDMX library that implements a subset of the standard, focusing on the most-used elements
- [sdmxthon](https://github.com/Meaningful-Data/sdmxthon) (Close to be deprecated) is a simple SDMX-ML 2.1 library to handle SDMX data and metadata

### VTL
- [vtlengine](https://github.com/Meaningful-Data/vtlengine) is a complete VTL (Validation and Transformation Language) software to analyse, format and run VTL scripts.

### DPM
- [xbridge](https://github.com/Meaningful-Data/xbridge) converts XBRL-XML into XBRL-CSV on EBA taxonomies
